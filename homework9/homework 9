1) socket.io is used to communicate between the bone and the browser.
2) when an led is click it calls the onclick funciton wich sends a signal over the i2c line and changes the color of the button
3) .on is the css entry which changes the color of the led matrix
4) in order to change the led I will change onclick and the matrix function. the bowser will send which item has been clicked. and the matrix gets it's values from the registers on the led grid.
